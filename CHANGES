CHANGES

Version 0.0.3 to 0.0.4

   - New regtype objects:
     The strings have been replaced with a small RegType object. Also, older
     versions used tcp as the default protocol. The protocol is now mandatory.
     However, the new syntax is much more flexible. See README.

   - Callback signature changed:
     flags is now a property of the info object (info.flags)

   - possibly more
