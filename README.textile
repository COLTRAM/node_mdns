h1. node_mdns - service discovery for node.js

node_mdns adds support for multicast DNS service discovery, also known as zeroconf or bonjour to "node.js":/ry/node. It provides an object-oriented interface to announce and browse services on the local network.

Internally, it uses the mDNSResponder API which is available on all major platforms.

h2. Build, Installation and Dependencies

On Linux and other systems using the avahi daemon the avahi dns_sd compat library and its header files are required.

node_mdns is available as a npm package. To fetch, compile and install the add-on do:

bc. npm install mdns

If you want to play with the latest source code, here is a more manual approach:

bc.. git clone http://github.com/agnat/node_mdns
cd node_mdns
node-waf configure build && ./run_tests
