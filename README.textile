h1. node_mDNS

h2. Synopsis

node_mDNS is a "node.js":/ry/node add-on. It adds support for multicast DNS service discovery, also known as zeroconf or bonjour.

It provides an object-oriented interface to announce and browse services.

Internally, it uses the mDNSResponder API which is available on all major platforms.

h2. Build

Currently only tested on Mac OS X. Other platforms will require some tweaking of wscript.

bc. node-waf configure build
sudo node-waf install

h2. Quickstart

p. To import the add-on use something like this:

bc. var mDNS = require('mDNS');

p. Announce a TCP server on port 4321 with service type 'http':

bc.. var ad = mDNS.createAdvertisement('http', 4321, mDNS.TCP);

ad.start();
setTimeout(function() { ad.stop(); }, 10000);
